Team E - Udemy Courses - README

E-Udemy-App is a prototype created to search, sort, filter, and analyze the selected Udemy courses dataset.
This has been created as a part of MSc Data Science-Python assignment.

Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/udemy-courses-revenue-generation-and-course-anal

The following libraries are required for this project:

- matplotlib.pyplot : Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated,and interactive visualizations in Python
- pandas : It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.
    Ex.Data cleansing,Data fill Data normalization Merges and joins Data visualization Statistical analysis Data inspection Loading and saving data And much more.
- seaborn : seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics for random statistical representation.
- sqlite3 : SQLite3 module is used to integrate the SQL database with python, a standardised python DBI API 2.0
- import_ipynb : It defines notebook loader that allows to iimport other ipynd files into your current ipynd file. 

File Structure:
- main.ipynb : main file and includes all the classes
- db_connection.ipynb : database file and establishing connection with database
- db.db : database file and the table

Dataset: Entry Level Project Sheet - 3.1-data-sheet-udemy-courses-web-development.csv

Set up Task:
- You should import "import_ipynb" into "main.ipynb" and install it in terminal using the following command => !pip install import_ipynb

How E-Udemy-App works:

- Step 1:
--Download "E-Udemy-App.zip" folder and extract

- Step 2:
--import import_ipynb => !pip install import_ipynb

- Step 3:
--Open "main.ipynb" file and run it in Jupyter notebook.

- Step 4:
--register with your name and email to use the application.

- Step 5:
--The app asks "what do you want?" and the user have 2 options.
---1) Search, Sort, Filter Courses
---2) Analyze Courses

- Step 6-1:
--If the user press 1, in this case, the app displays 9 functions and the user can press from 1 to 9 to use the app features or press 10 to back to the previous menu. Functions are:
--- 1 : Search Course by Course_id 
--- 2 : Search Course by Keyword 
--- 3 : Search Course by Url 
--- 4 : Search Course by Level 
--- 5 : Sort Courses by Subscibers 
--- 6 : Sort Courses by Reviews 
--- 7 : Sort Courses by Rating 
--- 8 : Sort Courses by Date 
--- 9 : Filter Courses by Pricing 
--- 10 : Back to the Previous Menu 

- Step 6-2:
--If the user press 2, in this case, the app displays 20 functions and the user can press from 1 to 20 to use the app features or press 21 to back to the previous menu. Functions are:
 --- 1 : Primitive Analysis 
 --- 2 : Level vs Price 
 --- 3 : Num_subscribers vs Num_reviews
 --- 4 : Num_subscribers vs Num_lectures 
 --- 5 : Num_reviews vs Rating 
 --- 6 : Content_duration vs Rating
 --- 7 : Content_duration vs Num_reviews 
 --- 8 : Price vs Num_subscribers 
 --- 9 : Price vs Num_reviews 
 --- 10 : Price vs Num_lectures 
 --- 11 : Price vs Rating 
 --- 12 : Price vs Content_duration
 --- 13 : Num_reviews vs Num_lectures 
 --- 14 : Num_reviews vs Level 
 --- 15 : Num_lectures vs Level
 --- 16 : Num_lectures vs Rating 
 --- 17 : Num_lectures vs Content_duration 
 --- 18 : Level vs Content_duration
 --- 19 : Level vs Rating 
 --- 20 : Num_courses_vs_Subject_area 
 --- 21 : back to the previous menu
